# Web File System

This repository serves the web content of the *Web File System* demonstration
site.

Web File System is a library intended to abstract interactions between various
online or client-side JavaScript file systems by providing a unified interface
between them. Documentation is listed on the website itself.

## Tools
- React.js (framework)
- Google Drive (option for drive mounting)

## Personal Notes
Once again, this project took much longer than expected to implement, due to
complications with implementing the React side & getting it to work well with
the generic JavaScript that the WFS library uses. Additionally, feature creep
struck again and a couple of features had to be cut for time.

When I come back to this project, file copying & moving are to be the immediate
priorities.
